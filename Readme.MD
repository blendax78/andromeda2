A Flask backend with a React frontend.

Currently, the backend isn't utilized (no saving to/from database yet).

To run, you will need to have node, npm, & bower installed.

From main directory:
```
bower install
npm install
```

Once dependencies are installed:
```
sh dev.sh

```

Then, go to http://localhost:8080/app/templates/dev.html
